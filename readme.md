# Testing
The input file "test_operation.txt" will be used to test the program. It is generated by the "txt_generator.cpp". It has 40110 operations based on the requirements. 
# Compilation
The operations are written in command word. Therefore, "main.cpp" is written to process the input file "test_operation.txt" and a output file "output.txt" will be generated. 
In the "main.cpp", the string "input_file_path" may need to change according to the location of the "test_operation.txt".
