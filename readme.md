# Stock Tracker

- A project to train DSA. Both AVL Tree and Hash table is used.
- "Report.pdf" is written to analyse the running time of function wrote. 

## Report

- You can see the pdf file in *../Report/report.pdf* if you wish to see the full version.
- The report is written in LaTex
![Report Page 1](./Report/Report%20Page%201.jpg)

## Testing

- The input file "test_operation.txt" will be used to test the program. It is generated by the "txt_generator.cpp". It has 40110 operations based on the requirements.

## Compilation

- The operations are written in command word. Therefore, "main.cpp" is written to process the input file "test_operation.txt" and a output file "output.txt" will be generated.
- In the "main.cpp", the string "input_file_path" may need to change according to the location of the "test_operation.txt".
- The output file "output.txt" contains all the output. Use cmd/ctrl + f to seacrh the follwing keyword which means the fucntion is being used:

1. "insertNewStock": insert-new-stock(x,p)
2. "updatePrice": update-price(x,p)
3. "increaseVolume": increase-volume(x, v_inc)
4. "lookUpByID": lookup-by-id(x)
5. "priceRange": price-range(p1, p2)
6. "maxVol": max-vol

- Each output will have the corresponding number given by the editor. Using that we can know the number of time the function is being used.
